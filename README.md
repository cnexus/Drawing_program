<h1>Drawing Program</h1>

A drawing program that I wrote the very first time I touched Java code. Written circa summer 2011.

This program is my take on MS Paint, and I was getting ready to extend the functionality of the program to allow for drawing multi-sided polygons, not just the allowed rectangle and square shapes.
